# Irish Dataset Analysis

By Michael Lawal

## Summary of project
This project demonstrates how to load, analyze, and visualize the Iris dataset using Python. The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and a target variable indicating the species of the flower (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).
This repository contains python scripts that:
1. Loads and examines the iris dataset
2. Performs statisctical calculations such as mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and median for each feature.
3. Visualize the data using histograms, scatter plots, regression lines, box plots, and pair plots.
4. Calculates and displays the coefficient of determination R2 for the relationship between two of the features.
5. Generates a correlation matrix heatmap.
